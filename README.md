# react-dev-guide
GRT React style guide

## Examples to steal from
 - [airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react)
 - [David Chang](http://reactjsnews.com/react-style-guide-patterns-i-like/)

## Goals
The purpose of this repo is to standardize on one set of best practices, tips and tricks for React development at GRT and to provide a reference for new React devs. This will allow those of us that are new to React to get up to speed quickly and those of us with some experience to move easily between projects and find our way around familiar codebases.

## Submitting Issues
If you see something say something. The best way to report a bug, request a feature or just start a conversation is to create and issue on the relevant repository. For example if you're infuriated by the grammar of this document, you're encouraged to [create and issue here](https://github.com/GRT/react-dev-guide/issues).  [More on Github issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).
